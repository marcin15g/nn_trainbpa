#While testing final result, iterate 1000 times through same params, to get avarage score

#Try to find the optimal params for 3 train/tast ratios - 0.2 / 0.5 / 0.8
# Find optimal n_epoch and n_hidden for the neural network

#Find optimal adaptive l_rate params
#Compare const and adaptive l_rate


#1 Find optimal epochs and hidden_layers for 0.2 ratio - acc only  /// h8 e500 /// acc for 1000iterations: 
#2 Find optimal epochs and hidden_layers for 0.5 ratio - acc only /// h14 e500
#3 Find optimal epochs and hidden_layers for 0.8 ratio - acc only /// h11 e950


#4 adaptive l_rate for 0.2 ratio - iterations for cost<0.0001 / amount of incidents (acc<60%)
#5 compare l_rate (test range) to optimal adaptive rate - iterations for cost<0.0001
